The project is a mail-detection system using Arudino and ESP32/ESP8266.
A digital sensor (tilt sensor) detects when the flip on the mailbox is opened and an analogue sensor (phototransistor) detects when there is light coming in. An email is then sent to the user over WiFi when the flip is opened and mail is in the mailbox.
The motivation behind the project is to not check the mailbox unless there is mail in it, and to remember to collect the mail. 
The system is powered by a power bank. This makes the system more sustainable as no battery is needed and it can be recharged.
